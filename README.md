## Tech Infrastructure for Chapters

#### E-Mail

* You can get your personal email name@rladies.org and one for your chapter, e.g.,
  boston@rladies.org, which forwards to all organisers of a chapter.
  Erin (erin@rladies.org) can create those for you.
* Set-up in an email client: see [wiki](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/How-to-access-your-rladies-email-address)

#### Meetup 

* Currently [meetup.com](meetup.com) accounts are self-funded, but we are waiting to get
  a grant from the R-Consortium. We have been sharing accounts so that we can put three
  meetups on one account for the same price, or rather, someone who is paying $15/mo for
  a meetup.com account sets up three groups under their account (that’s the limit). Ask
  in the #new_chapters channel on Slack if anybody has any groups left on their account.
  We are trying to cluster groups geographically.
* Form a group on the [meetup.com](meetup.com) site with the name
  “R-Ladies [your location]”, for example: “R-Ladies San Francisco” or “R-Ladies London”.
  (Note: capital “L” for the Ladies)
* Modify the URL of the meetup.com to be: meetup.com/rladies-your-location
  (lower-case, without the dash between r & ladies)
* If you are setting up a group for a different chapter: you can make the local organiser
  a "co-organiser" of the meetup once they have joined the group.

#### Twitter

* Local Twitter handle (optional) should also use the @RLadiesLocation format,
  for example: @RLadiesSF and @RLadiesLondon, with the same name as the meetup.com group
  name (above).

#### GitHub

* There is a [global organisation](http://github.com/rladies) to which you can add
  repositories as needed. Contact any of the admins (e.g., @hannah) of the GitHub
  organisation to be added as a member.
* Local GitHub organisation (optional) should also use the “R-Ladies [your location]”
  format for the organisation name, for example: “R-Ladies San Francisco” or
  “R-Ladies London”, and “rladies-your-location” for the URL.

#### Slack

* To join the [global Slack](http://r-ladies.slack.com) please send an e-mail to
  slack@rladies.org.
* Please add your city or chapter to your Slack profile.  
* You can create a channel on the global Slack for communication within your chapter,
  e.g., #rladies-san-francisco.
  


## Organising Events

### Launch Event

Different ideas:

* Kickoff/Meet & Greet: Present your vision/idea for the meetup, invite others to help
  organise.
* Lightning talks: Short talks of 5 minutes on a range of topics. This format usually
  also has a low barrier to participate.
* Survey: Some chapters have set up an online questionnaire before their first meeting to
  find out what people were looking for in the meetup. Here are examples from
  [Paris](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPHTc1CuMHFmisaR53kM0G5iReXZfZH6CcKV6wsX0Gww5m3Q/viewform?c=0&w=1) and [Madrid](https://chucheria.typeform.com/to/dGf4OR).
* Making your group/event known: you can reach out to some other meetups in the area which
  might have overlapping audiences (e.g., data science meetup and R user groups) and
  universities (e.g., statistics departments).
* Finding co-organisers: Some chapters have found their organising team at the launch
  event, others have included a question on who would be interested in organising in the
  initial survey.

### (Further) Events

* Deciding on desired/feasible frequency of events (once a month, once every few months?)
* Appropriate event formats depending on profile of the local community. More academic, more industry? Talks, tutorials, lightning talks, drop-in sessions, socials? Working through online courses together? 
* How to find venues to host meetups (for free!)
* How to find speakers
* Hot to find material: online courses, material developed by other R-Ladies (should in
  future go on the [GitHub organisation](http://github.com/rladies))
* How to find sponsors for refreshments
* Event registration, management and data collection
    * How to use Eventbrite to manage meetup attendance & data collection (or any
      equivalent local available platforms) - meetup is quite limited for managing events
    * Set up Google Analytics on your meetup to collect data
    * _How to create R-Ladies Database_
* Advertising, Publicity and Event Discovery: Twitter, LinkedIn, Eventbrite etc. (i.e.,
  popular marketing channels and platforms in your area);  _Database (once developed!)_

### Code of Conduct

Deciding on and enforcing a local variation of the global recommended position as is
appropriate for the specific community: Individuals who identify as women can be leaders,
mentors, and members/attendees, others are welcome to attend as event guests.

  of guys that they are being discriminated against, etc.
